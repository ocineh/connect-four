# Connect four
## What is it ?
This is simply my version of connect four, for the moment the only way to win is to line up 4 tokens vertically or horizontally.
## Installation
It's a simple project done with rust you just need cargo to compile the program.
```bash
cargo build --release
```
## Usage
You can either compile it (see above) with cargo or directly launch it with cargo.
```bash
cargo run
```
