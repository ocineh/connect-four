# Puissance 4
## What is it ?
This is simply my version of connect four, for the moment the only way to win is to line up 4 tokens vertically or horizontally.
## Installation
It's a simple project done with rust you just need cargo to compile the program.
```bash
cargo build --release
```
## Usage
You can either compile it (see above) with cargo or directly launch it with cargo.
```bash
cargo run
```
## Roadmap
*[ ] Create a game board and be able to display it in the terminal
*[ ] Check if the tray is full.
*[ ] Check if there is a winner vertically and horizontally.
*[ ] To be able to play a move by entering only the column.
*[ ] Being able to play a game with someone else.
*[ ] To be able to play a game against the computer (but just random hits).
*[ ] Check if there is a winner diagonally.
